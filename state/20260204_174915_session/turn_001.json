  "session_summary": "Intro: The last sliver of sun bled below the horizon, casting long, distorted shadows across the Town Square. A chill wind, smelling of salt and something darker, tugged at your cloak as you stepped into the space. The bronze fountain, normally bustling with children, stood silent and still, its water reflecting the fading light like a bruised eye. Around the fountain, the townsfolk moved with a sluggishness, their faces etched with a weary preoccupation. Conversations were hushed, glances darted nervously, and hands instinctively reached for the worn leather pouches at their belts. A few figures huddled near the Market Stalls, exchanging worried whispers. Jessa, the Town Crier, was attempting to maintain a semblance of order, shouting a brief, repetitive announcement about \u201ckeeping calm\u201d and \u201creporting any unusual sightings,\u201d but her voice lacked conviction. The Street Performer Jorin was packing up his lute, his usual jovial demeanor replaced with a frown. To the east, the Harbor Gate loomed, a dark silhouette against the twilight, and the faint cries of gulls carried on the wind. The air itself felt thick with unspoken questions. You notice a small, tarnished copper cup lying near the Old Well, and a few scattered coins \u2013 bronze and copper \u2013 near the fountain. The smell of woodsmoke was strongest near the Watch Barracks, where a constable was pacing restlessly.  The Temple of the Tide stood silently to the north, its stone weathered and ancient, and to the south, the South Bridge offered a narrow view of the restless harbor.\nRecap: You make your way towards the Town Hall, a squat, grey building constructed from weathered stone. Its windows are dark and shuttered, giving it a somber appearance. The heavy oak doors are reinforced with iron bands, and a small, tarnished plaque above them bears the faded inscription: \u201cSeat of Order.\u201d As you draw closer, you notice a faint scent of beeswax and old parchment emanating from within. A single constable, Sergeant Davies, is standing guard before the entrance, his hand resting on the pommel of his sword, scanning the square with a wary expression. He nods curtly as you approach, but doesn\u2019t offer any greeting. The steps leading up to the doors are worn and slick with dampness. You can see a small, barred window at the back of the building, overlooking the square.",
