  "session_summary": "Intro: The sun has long since dipped below the horizon, leaving the sky in bruised shades of purple and charcoal. The Town Square, usually a hub of life, is now suffocated by a heavy, suffocating silence. The damp chill of the evening air clings to your skin, and the shadows stretching from the Market Stalls and the Watch Barracks seem to lengthen with every passing moment. The few townsfolk you see are huddled together, their faces drawn and pale, their eyes darting nervously toward the dark corners of the cobblestones. The air is thick with hushed whispers, though the words are indistinct. You\u2019ve heard the rumors already, carried on the wind: fresh bloodstains appearing in the streets with impossible frequency, yet no bodies are missing, no families are gone. It is a mystery that has the entire town walking on eggshells, paralyzed by a violence that leaves no trace. You stand in the center of the square, the new arrival in a community that seems to hold its collective breath, waiting for the next stain to appear.\nRecap: You turn away from the suffocating silence of the square, the cobblestones beneath your boots crunching softly in the twilight. The Town Hall rises before you, a monolith of dark grey stone that seems to drink the last of the dying light. Gargoyles, worn smooth by centuries of rain and wind, stare down from the roofline like silent sentinels, their eyes reflecting the bruised purple of the sky. The air here is even colder, carrying the scent of decay, old parchment, and the lingering dampness of the evening. You reach the imposing oak doors, the iron handles cold and slick against your palm. With a heavy push, the wood swings inward on well-oiled hinges, emitting a low groan that echoes slightly in the vastness of the entryway. Inside, the corridor stretches into darkness, lit intermittently by the flickering glow of a few sconces. The walls are lined with heavy tapestries and portraits of faces long past, their painted eyes seeming to follow you. The silence inside is absolute, heavy with the weight of secrets and the dread of the bloodstains outside. To your left, a grand staircase spirals upward into shadow; to your right, a corridor leads toward what appears to be the Mayor\u2019s office or perhaps the archives. The town's mystery waits here, tucked away in the quiet halls of power.\nRecap: You turn your gaze toward the grand staircase spiraling upward into the gloom, intending to make the ascent. However, just as you take a step, you realize the path is impassable. A heavy iron grate, welded shut, bars the way forward. There is no way past it. You are back in the Town Hall entryway, the flickering sconces casting long shadows across the stone floor, and the silence of the building pressing in around you once more.\nRecap: You attempt to leave the Town Hall and head toward the Wizard's House, but the darkness between the buildings is too thick, and the dread that hangs over the town makes the path impossible to traverse tonight. You find yourself standing just outside the heavy oak doors, unable to cross the distance. The Town Hall stands silent behind you, the flickering sconces casting long shadows across the stone floor, and you remain in the Town Hall.",
