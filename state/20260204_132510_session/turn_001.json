  "session_summary": "Intro: The scent of brine and woodsmoke hangs heavy in the air as you step into the Town Square. Dusk has fully embraced Oakhaven, casting long, distorted shadows from the buildings that ring the space. Most of the townsfolk are huddled near the Bronze Fountain, their faces etched with a weary resignation. A few children play listlessly, kicking at loose stones, but their laughter feels muted, swallowed by the growing gloom. The fountain itself is dry, its once-gleaming surface dulled with grime, reflecting the somber light. You notice a small crowd gathered around the Old Well, a woman murmuring prayers, and a couple arguing quietly near the Market Stalls, their voices strained. The air is thick with unspoken anxieties. Jessa, the Town Crier, is pacing, shouting about a \u201cdark omen\u201d \u2013 a phrase that seems to hang in the air, adding to the unsettling feeling. You take a moment to examine the stains themselves. They\u2019re dark, almost black, marring the cobblestones near the South Bridge. Small, circular, and disturbingly fresh-looking, considering the lack of any immediate signs of a victim. The Street Performer, Jorin, is packing up his instruments, his usual cheerful demeanor replaced with a nervous fidgeting. The Watch Barracks stand silent and watchful at the edge of the square. The Temple of the Tide looms behind, its stone columns casting a long, ominous shadow. There\u2019s a palpable sense of unease, a feeling that something terrible is about to happen, or perhaps, has already.\nRecap: The cobblestones beneath your boots are worn smooth by countless footsteps, slick with a dampness that clings to the twilight. You push past the lingering murmurs of the townsfolk, their faces etched with a mixture of fear and confusion, and head towards the imposing structure of the Town Hall. It\u2019s a squat, grey building constructed of dark stone, its windows dark and unblinking. The heavy oak doors are reinforced with iron bands, and a single, flickering torch casts a dancing shadow above the entrance. As you approach, you notice a small, brass plaque above the doors: \u201cOakhaven \u2013 Seat of Justice.\u201d The air around the building feels colder, heavier, as if holding a secret. You pause, taking in the details \u2013 the chipped paint, the weathered stonework, the sense of quiet authority\u2026 and a faint, metallic scent, like old blood.",
