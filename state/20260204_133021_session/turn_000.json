  "session_summary": "Intro: The last sliver of sun dipped below the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the buildings that ring the town square. A persistent drizzle had begun, slicking the cobblestones and reflecting the flickering gaslights in distorted pools. The air smelled of wet wood, brine from the nearby harbor, and something else\u2026 something vaguely metallic and unsettling. Most of the townsfolk huddled near the Bronze Fountain, their faces etched with a quiet sorrow. Conversations were muted, punctuated by the rhythmic splash of water and the mournful strumming of Jorin, the street performer, who played a melancholic tune on his lute. He seemed oblivious to the tension, lost in his music, but even his notes felt heavy, laden with the unspoken dread. You\u2019ve arrived in Oakhaven seeking answers, a newcomer drawn by whispers of a strange affliction, and the unsettling quiet of a town grappling with a mystery. A few townsfolk glance at you with wary eyes, their expressions unreadable, before returning to their somber reflections. The Town Crier, Jessa, has just finished his rounds, his voice a strained monotone, repeating the same unsettling news: \u201cBloodstains\u2026 found throughout the town\u2026 no missing persons\u2026 investigation ongoing\u2026\u201d He doesn\u2019t elaborate, but the implication hangs heavy in the air. As you observe, a figure approaches you \u2013 Mitch, a lumberjack, his face pale and slick with sweat, his hands nervously twisting a small, worn wooden carving. He seems agitated, his gaze darting around the square as if searching for something, or someone.",
