  "session_summary": "Player: I look around the courtyard, do I see anybody?\nRecap: The sun has slipped below the horizon, and the harbor town is swallowed by twilight. Lanterns flicker to life, their amber glow pooling over the cobbled square. A faint breeze carries the scent of salt and fish from the nearby docks. Around you, the market stalls creak as vendors shuffle their wares, while the distant clatter of a blacksmith\u2019s hammer echoes from the workshop on the eastern corner. Children dart between crates, their laughter mingling with the murmur of weary townsfolk. Their eyes dart around, half\u2011hearted and wary, as they whisper about the strange bloodstains that have appeared overnight in homes\u2014red, thick, and yet no bodies are found. The air carries a chill that isn\u2019t just the night; it\u2019s a sense of unease, a collective exhaustion.\n\nJorin the street performer, juggling knives and colored stones, pauses mid\u2011act to catch a ripple of gossip. He offers a quick, almost sympathetic grin, but his eyes flicker to the crowd as if he\u2019s hearing something others miss. Nearby, Jessa the town crier stands on a low crate, her handbell still ringing faintly from her last announcement. She leans toward the center of the square, her voice barely audible over the murmur, reminding everyone of the latest reports of \u201cunsettling stains\u201d and the mayor\u2019s growing desperation.\n\nAt the edge of the square, the fountain sputters, its water catching the lantern light and turning it into a silver ripple. The cobbles beneath your feet are slick with the day\u2019s rain, and faint red stains glisten where the water has pooled. A feeling of being watched lingers, but no one seems to notice your presence as you stand, taking it all in.",
